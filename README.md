# NCI: Nature-Computer Interactions

## Overview

An experimental web application exploring how AI perceives nature. NCI uses computer vision models to detect "ghost" patterns in natural phenomena, revealing the pareidolia-like behavior of machine learning systems.

## 🌊 About

This project runs pose detection and other ML models on videos of natural phenomena (oceans, forests, clouds) to find instances where the algorithm "hallucinates" human-like forms in non-human inputs. It's an artistic exploration of the boundaries between AI perception and natural patterns.

## ✨ Features

- Full-screen video display with multiple input options
- Support for default nature videos, webcam input, and uploaded videos
- Real-time pose detection with ultra-low confidence thresholds
- Visual overlay of detected patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nci.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd nci

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 💻 Technologies

- Vue.js
- MediaPipe ML framework
- HTML5 Canvas for visualizations
- Web Media APIs

## 📝 Usage

1. Visit the application in your browser
2. Select from default nature videos or use your own
3. Watch as the AI attempts to find human-like patterns in natural movements
4. Experiment with different videos to see how patterns emerge

## 📷 Video Recommendations

For best results, use videos of natural phenomena with subtle, continuous movement such as:

- Ocean waves
- Clouds in motion
- Trees moving in wind
- Flowing water
- Sand dunes or smoke patterns
